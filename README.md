## A detailed and up-to-date analysis of the fin-tech firm Coinsquare. 

Case Study: COINSQUARE

*Name of Company 

>COINSQUARE

*When was the company incorporated? 

>Coinsquare was incorporated in 2014.

*Who are the founders of the company? 

>The founder of Coinsquare is Virgile Rostand. During the earliest stages of Coinsquare's development as a company, Virgile served as Coinsquare’s marketing director,  it's security analyst and its primary support chief. Prior to his founding of Coinsquare, Virgile Rostand worked at a variety of different traditional financial institutions, including the Bank of Montreal and GoNumerical. Virgile Rostand served as a consultant to both institutions. In 2017 he was joined by Cole Diamond who is the current CEO of Coinsquare. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

>Coinsquare.com is a digital trading platform that facilitates the trading of 7 different cryptocurrencies. In order to understand the context in which Coinsquare was created, it is important to briefly review the history of Blockchain Technologies. After the 2008 Financial Crisis, the public's perception of financial institutions changed rapidly and trust in traditional institutions such as banks or governments had rapidly eroded. Blockchain technologies' initial promise/value proposition was to fill this vacuum of trust by providing customers with access to financial tools and markets, without having to rely on the traditional banking institutions/trusted 3rd parties/intermediaries. Unfortunately the early days of blockchain technologies were plagued by fraud, illegality, criminal prosecutions and a poor user interface. Rostand's background in applied mathematics, engineering and his previous experience working within the field of finance left him perfectly positioned to navigate the within the new and evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Rostand, specifically became interested in Blockchain technology in 2014, after watching the early success and resilience of Bitcoin, the world's first p2p cryptocurrency. The specific idea for Coinsquare was to provide a secure, reliable and regulated financial platform which would leverage blockchain technology to provide their customers value, while avoiding many of the pre-existing problems within the crypto space. In the early days of blockchain technology, the public's perception of the new technology was that it primarily existed as a tool for fraudsters and criminals. His mission was to provide legitimacy and credibility to the crypto community. Coinsquare accomplished this by providing customers with a secure, fast and reliable service for trading in cryptocurrencies that allows individuals to access the crypto-markets with an easy to understand user interface.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

>The company was founded in 2014 by Virgile Rostand, but it wasn't until 2017 that Coinsquare was able to raise 30 million dollars in venture capital funds and hire additional staff and brought the platform to the Canadian market. Coinsquare has raised CA$53M in over 4 separate rounds of funding. The latest funding came from a Series B round on the 8th of February 2018 raising CA$36M. Currently, Coinsquare’s lead investors are Riot Blockchain and Canaccord Genuity Group.2 Coinsquare is also considering a CA$150M (US$120) IPO on the Toronto Stock exchange to finance an overseas expansion.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

>Prior to the existence of FinTech firms such as Coinsquare, the cryptocurrency community was plagued by a number of specific problems. Most cryptocurrencies have a poor user interface and are plagued by issues of fraud and illicit activity. Since Blockchains are decentralized, open source projects, they primarily exist as an infrastructure of technology and computer code, without the usual architecture of products/services that exists within a traditional market.  Without marketing campaigns, consumer outreach, educational projects or proper user interfaces, many customers were hesitant to enter into the crypto space . The logistics of the technology itself are often misunderstood and this has led to many initial, early crypto-currency adopters suffering financial losses due to a combination of fraud and user-error and custodial problems on the exchanges themselves. Coinsquare solves this problem through the use of a proprietary technology, combined with an easy to understand user interface which prioritizes security and user-experience to facilitate the safe and reliable trading of multiple cryptocurrencies. In addition to their technology, they also work hand in hand with regulators, which has a desired result of legitimizing the crypto-markets and increasing overal adoption.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

>Coinsquare’s customers are individuals looking to trade in cryptocurrencies. Coinsquare’s customers are individuals looking to become involved in trading cryptocurrencies, but lack the technological or financial understanding to properly access crypto-markets. Coinsquares customers are primarily seeking a secure trading platform which hasn't been hacked or involved in criminality, like many of their competitors. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

>Coinsquare offers a simple and easy to understand platform for trading in cryptocurrencies. They provide an open and regulated financial platform. Unlike their competitors at BitFinex, Coinsquare enrages in proper due diligence of their customers through KYC best practices and will often turn down potential transactions which have been flagged by their compliance and anti-money laundering teams. Coinsquare also works collaboratively with the Ontario Securities Commission and routinely sends reports to FINTRAC, Canada's anti-money laundering watchdog. All of these measures contribute to an environment of much needed trust and reputation-based legitimacy within the cryptocurrency community. Coinsquare’s willingness to work with regulators is central to the company's core philosophy, which involves building and maintaining both the business and technological infrastructure that will allow the crypto community to mature into a trusted and reliable component of the financial world.  Coinsquare’s customers can rest assured knowing that their trading platform is legitimate, respected and unlikely to be involved in lawsuits or criminal prosecutions. Unlike many other crypto-exchanges, Coinsquare can proudly state that they have not lost a single coin in 3 years of trading. Their primary  competitive advantage is their reputation and  the trust they have built with their customers. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

>Coinsquare uses proprietary technology developed by its founder Virgile Rostand, which prioritizes security. All of Coinsquare's trades which take place on Coinsquare’s platform utilize SSL encryption, two factor authentication and cold storage of digital assets. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

>Coinsquare is a leader within the Blockchain and Crypto space. They provide a platform for trading digital assets, services to support cryptocurrency mining, investment products to support emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence and offers licensing agreements to clients that wish to utilize their proprietary technology. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

>At the time of the company's founding in 2014, the only large and well known cryptocurrencies utilizing blockchain technology were Bitcoin and Etherum. Over the last 5-10 years the crypto space has seen a massive level of development and innovation in the form of new cryptocurrencies, the emergence of smart contracts, multiple crypto exchanges, wallet companies/custodial services, trading platforms and constantly improving and evolving mining software/hardware such like ASICs. In addition to this, many countries have adopted a regulatory framework to incorporate blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies into the world of legitimate financial markets. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

>Coinsquare’s main competitors are other trading platforms such as Coinspace, Bitpay and Bitgo. 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Coinsquare has helped onboard thousands of new users into the crypto-space and they have provided a model for integrating blockchain technologies within the pre-existing framework of economic regulation and government law. They have also carved out a well deserved space for Canada, as a leader within the Blockchain-Crypto Community. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The core metrics used to measure success for a trading platform in the cryptocurrencies-marketplace are trading volume per day, number of currencies supported by the platform and the amount of tokens/coins lost to fraud, hacking or other security failures. Coinsquare's 24 hour trading volume is $8,421,185.22, the platform supports 7 top cryptocurrencies and the company has not lost a single coin due to security failures. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Many of Coinsquare’s direct competitors are larger trading platforms, which have higher 24 hour trading volumes and support more than 7 tokens, but almost none of Coinsquare’s competitors can compete with their security model and platform-integrity. For example, BitFinex has an average 24 hour trading volume of $188 million and supports approximately 350 trading pairs on its platform. But BitFinex has also been responsible for several of the largest security breaches in the entire history of cryptocurrencies. In August of 2016, the value of 119,756 BTC were stolen from Bitfinex and in 2019 the New York Attorney General's office has alleged that Bitfinex lost $850 million dollars and secretly used tokens from the stablecoin operator Tether in order to cover the losses. It is important, when evaluating Coinsquare’s overall success, to recognize that Coinsquare’s security model and platform integrity leave them perfectly positioned to inherit greater portions of the market if their competitors continue to operate with poor security models and engage in unethical business practices.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Many of Coinsquare’s competitors offer advanced trading platforms which provide their users the opportunity to complete advance analysis for day trading of different cryptocurrencies. Coinsquare should consider integrating more platforms for analysis into their trading platform to provide a better, more robust user experience

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Offering different mechanisms for performing analysis on their platform would support the onboarding of new customers, who were accustomed to having access to similar services on one of the larger trading platforms. Integrating these additional features would not compromise Coinsquare’s overall philosophy of prioritizing security and reputational integrity. While it may be tempting to for a company like Coinsquare to simply list additional tokens and cryptocurrencies onto their exchange, it is the opinion of this writer that Coinsquare should only integrate well established and secure cryptocurrencies onto their platform and that they should continue to be discerning in onboarding additional tokens. Coinsquare’s main competitive advantage is their reputation for integrity and this could be compramised if they adopt untested cryptocurrencieswhich are largly percieved by the public as pump and dumb scams or do not have sufficient mining support or hash-rate to provide a robust and secure blockchain. 

## Summary 

>Coinsquare is a dynamic and adaptable, mid-sized company with a stellar reputation and well established leader within the Canadian Fin-Tech community. They are positioned perfectly for growth within the Canadian markets, but are also in the process of expanding overseas. They execute their trades using a proprietary technology developed by their founder, Virgile Rostand and they have a stellar track record for security and overall integrity. Since Coinsquare was founded in 2014, they have expanded their products/services to include items like Coincapital, which offer investment products focused on emerging technologies like blockchain development and artificial intelligence. They have also cemented Canada's position as a leader within the Crypto-Community.
